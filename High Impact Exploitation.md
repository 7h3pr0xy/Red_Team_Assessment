###High Impact Exploitation
```
This section mainly focuses on the Post-exploitation which can be show to the higher management for impact or showing risk such as reading emails ( either by reading .pst files or having access to the exchange server ), having access to the File-servers holding confidential data, able to access employees laptop/ desktop ( watch them via webcam/ listen to the surroundings using microphones). The assumption is we have already compromised the domain administrator of the Windows Domain.

Outlook data file .pst
A Personal Folders file (.pst) is an Outlook data file that stores your messages and other items on your computer.
readpst ( linux ) or readpst.exe can be used to read pst mailbox for passwords

ReadPST / LibPST v0.6.59
Little Endian implementation being used.
Usage: readpst [OPTIONS] {PST FILENAME}
OPTIONS:
       -V      - Version. Display program version
       -D      - Include deleted items in output
       -M      - Write emails in the MH (rfc822) format
       -S      - Separate. Write emails in the separate format
       -e      - As with -M, but include extensions on output files
       -h      - Help. This screen
       -o <dirname>    - Output directory to write files to. CWD is changed *after* opening pst file
       -q      - Quiet. Only print error messages
       -r      - Recursive. Output in a recursive format
       -t[eajc]        - Set the output type list. e = email, a = attachment, j = journal, c = contact
       -w      - Overwrite any output mbox files
       
       Only one of -M -S -e -k -m -r should be specified

Once readpst has converted the contents of the .pst file to plaintext documents, we can search through them using the built-in “findstr” command.

Once readpst has converted the contents of the .pst file to plaintext documents, we can search through them using the built-in “findstr” command.

findstr /s /i /m “password” *.*

“/s” tells findstr to search through the current directory and subdirectories.
“/i” specifies that the search should be case insensitive.
“/m” tells findstr to output the file name rather than the file contents – if we output the contents, we may quickly be swamped with output that we’ll still have to sift through.  Depending on the amount of output, you may also quickly exceed cmd.exe’s limits.
*.*, of course, means that we’re searching through files of any name and any type.
